This software, called ‘Airport Management System’, will allow for the company to access their database securely and safely in a user-friendly online environment. Also, the software allow for them to change the flight and employee informations with ease. The software will be in sync with Web App, allowing for reservation service for their customers. Authorized users will be able to search flights, airports and flight company and see their details. The authorized user will also be able to add or delete pilot, host, passenger, flight, flight company and airport from the system.
